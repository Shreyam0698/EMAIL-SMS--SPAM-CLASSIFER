# Email/SMS - Spam Detection
This repository contains an Email/SMS Spam Detection project that classifies messages as either spam or non-spam using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to help filter out unwanted spam messages, making it applicable for email filtering, SMS spam detection, and other similar use cases.

Features
Spam Detection: Classifies emails and SMS messages as spam or non-spam using a trained machine learning model.
Data Analysis: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover patterns and characteristics of spam messages.
NLP Techniques: Utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a supervised learning model to accurately detect spam messages.
Streamlit Deployment: The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-sms-spam-detection.git
cd email-sms-spam-detection

2. Install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
bash
streamlit run app.py

Usage:
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the Streamlit app.
Upload a CSV file containing email/SMS messages or input text manually.
Click on the "Analyze" button to view the spam detection results.

Project Structure:
app.py: The main file for running the Streamlit application.
model.py: Contains the machine learning model and related functions.
data/: Directory containing sample datasets.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

Data:
The dataset used for this project consists of unlabeled email and SMS messages categorized as spam or non-spam. You can replace the sample dataset with your own data to perform spam detection on different messages.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of spam vs. non-spam messages, the most frequent words in spam messages, and other insights. Visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create informative plots.

Machine Learning Model:
A machine learning model was trained on labeled data to classify messages as spam or non-spam. The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure its effectiveness.

Streamlit Deployment:
The project is deployed using Streamlit, enabling users to interact with the application by uploading their own datasets, viewing analysis results, and exploring visualizations.
